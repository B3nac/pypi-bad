# pypi-bad
Bad packages from the pypi repository

These packages have been found in the pypi repository, they use variations of existing
package names with the intent of hoping that people accidentally install them.

Some of them were probably created for research purposes, others may have malicious
intent behind them. All these packages have been removed from the official pypi
repository, so I'm archiving them here. Please don't install them, they're only
here to document past issues with pypi.
