# pypi-bad
Bad packages from package management repository

These packages have been found in package management repositories like pypi
or npm. Some of them are typosquatting packages, others malicous dependencies.

Some of them were probably created for research purposes, others may have malicious
intent behind them. All these packages have been removed from the official
repositories, so I'm archiving them here. Please don't install them, they're only
here to document past issues with package management.

Originally this was for pypi packages only, thus the name.
